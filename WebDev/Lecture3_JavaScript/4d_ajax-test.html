            // Here I am calling jQuery with the $ symbol, but instead of grabbing an HTML tag, I am using the AJAX
            // functionality.  AJAX is a function within jQuery that lets us make requests to servers over the internet
            // Here we are making a GET request, which is something we will cover in the coming weeks.  But basically,
            // it is making a request for data and will not be altering that data at all.
            // in the get function, it takes 4 arguments
            //  --the url of where we want to getdata
            //  --a header (notice that I am just passing an empty header here, but often I need to fill this with
            //    security information
            //  --a callback function.  One I get the data from the server I am contacting, I may want to do something with
            //    it.  The response is the data I get from the internet.  I need to be careful with the data,
            //    as data from other websites can come in a variety of formats
            //  --the data type.  I am using JSONP, partly to get a JSON back, but also because this is a hacky way
            //    to overcome some security issues that come when running this code locally
